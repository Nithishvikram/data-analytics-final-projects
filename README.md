# data-analytics-final-projects

Objective
This project aims to analyze the reasons behind product returns in an e-commerce platform and identify patterns based on product categories, suppliers, geographies, and marketing channels. The goal is to reduce return rates by pinpointing high-risk areas and providing actionable insights.

Tools & Technologies

Python – Data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning (logistic regression)
SQL – Data extraction and transformation
Power BI – Interactive dashboard and visualization

Key Steps
Data Cleaning

Merged and cleaned order and return datasets
Handled missing values and standardized formats

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Calculated return percentages per category, supplier, geography, and marketing channel
Visualized high return zones using Power BI

Predictive Modeling

Built a logistic regression model to predict the probability of a return
Features include product category, price, discount, customer region, and return history

Power BI Dashboard

Created an interactive dashboard with:
Return rates by category and region
Supplier-wise return trends
High-risk product list

Deliverables

 Power BI Dashboard – Visual report for stakeholders
 Python Codebase – For logistic regression and data analysis
 CSV Output – List of high-return risk products with probabilities
